# 42 🏊‍♂️ Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for the 42 Piscine projects!
This repository contains all my work from the 42 Piscine programming bootcamp. The Piscine is an intense, immersive training program designed to introduce and deepen your understanding of C programming through a series of challenging and diverse projects.

## 🚀 Purpose

I created this repository to showcase my solutions and track my progress as I revisit and refine my C programming skills. Whether you're here to explore my solutions, seek inspiration, or just follow along on my journey, I hope you find this repository useful.
